# \# PyKV Session Store

# 

# \## Project Overview

# PyKV is a Python-based in-memory key-value store with persistence.

# It stores data in RAM for fast access and saves data to disk to avoid data loss.

# 

# \## Real-World Use Case

# This project is used to keep users logged in on websites

# (like Amazon or Instagram) by storing session data.

# 

# \## How the System Works

# 1\. User sends request through API

# 2\. Data is stored in memory (RAM)

# 3\. Data is saved to disk for safety

# 4\. Data is returned when requested
